
# Framework #

I decided to use Flask framework, because of following pros:

* Lightweight: It is a lightweight framework as it is independent of external libraries. It gives a quick start to the web development process of complex applications.
* Independent: Flask gives independent or full control to the developer for creating applications. You can experiment with the architecture or the libraries of the framework.
* Integrated Unit Testing: Flaskâ€™s integrated unit testing system enables faster debugging, robust development, and freedom to experiment.
* Secure Cookies: Secure cookie is an attribute of an HTTP request that enables the security of channels and ensures no unauthorized person has access to the text. Flask supports the feature of secure cookies.
* Compatible: Flask is compatible with the latest technologies like Machine Learning, Cloud, etc.
* Flexible and Scalable: Support WSGI templates that allow flexibility and scalability for web applications.
* It comes with a built-in server and debugger.
* Simple and adaptable configurations

# Best practices #

* Use .gitignore file
* Create virtual environment
* Generate requirements.txt
* Describe project in README

# Linter #

I use **Flake8** linter for Python and **markdownlint** for a Markdown
